- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Nicole
I am using this as a way of practicing report writing and walkthroughs for different certifications,
Eventually I will upload some scripts I have been tinkering with.

Coming soon, working on a blog posting site. Researching inbetween my practice times for PNPT! Ultimately I want to try again at getting OSCP!
This time, with better methodology, far more prepared report writing and far more through walkthroughs.

Reports to watch out for:
  HTB Cicada, when its allowed
  HTB Administrator, when its allowed
  HTB Chemistry, when its allowed
  TryHackMe Search!
  
Working on Dante ProLabs, I'll have a review of that, and not a walkthru our a report because that voids terms of service, so far I am really enjoying the challenge.
